She enjoyed it thoroughly and eagerly looked forward to every session. Under Adi's coaching, she improved her agility, reaction time, and motivation. Her achievements include:
      - 9th in 47th Maharashtra State Open (Under-13)
      - 8th in Matunga Gymkhana Open (Under-13)
      - 3rd in Dunlop Maharashtra State Closed Open
      She also performed very well in SFA games and Matunga Club Open finals.`

His workout regime, nutritional guidance, and intermittent fasting plan made all the difference. Beyond physical changes, my mental strength and endurance have increased dramatically.`
